# Tips for working with CSS Grids

## Overview of Grids

A common practice in creating responsive layouts in web sites is to use what's referred to as
a grid. Grids are tools used by designers and developers alike to help layout a page, align elements within the page and help define how much of the page those elements should take up for different screen sizes.

A very common implementation is the 12 column grid which is generally made up of three elements:
1. A grid container, which defines the left and right side boundaries (or the width) of your site.
1. A row, which lays out grid cells, and is responsible for wrapping the cells when they don't fit.
1. A cell, which takes up space in a row. Most of the time cells take up some multiple of one 12th of the width of the grid which is how we get the 12 column effect.

This is seen in some form or another popular CSS framework such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) and the [Foundation XY Grid](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html), but can also be implemented as in the native CSS-grid if your browser supports it. All of these systems are capable of creating other kinds of layouts beyond the 12 column grid, but it is still a popular choice to use them for this purpose.

Working with a grid system like this isn't all scotches and skittles, there are some things that are untuitive or require some workarounds. Here are some of my tips for working with grids.
